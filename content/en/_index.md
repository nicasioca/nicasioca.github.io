I spend a lot of time writing technical documentation, creating code, and working with developers and management teams to build systems that scale, so I think my educational background and hands on experience can save you a lot of trouble with getting into tech.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

## Learn Technical Writing
[Technical Writing](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing) is going to save a company, and this should be the first thing you care about when building and maintaining things (next to testing of course)
- Helps with writing your resume later
- Helps with writing your documentation for your Github repos

## Learn Python
Python is a great place to start:
> I recommend Python to land a job
- [Leetcode interview problems](https://github.com/nicasioca/leetcode)
- [CLI / Pandas Data Wrangling](https://github.com/nicasioca/migration-tool)

## Learn JavaScript
JavaScript is for practical applications:
> If you can't get a job with just Python, learn JavaScript to seal the deal
- [React for web development](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Native for mobile development](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Express.js for API server development](https://expressjs.com/)
  - Teaches you the typical RESTful API server with multiple API endpoints
- [Express.js with GraphQL server development](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/)
  - GraphQL is just one API endpoint!

## Learn Databases
SQL Databases / NoSQL Databases:
- Use [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as your JavaScript client to your MongoDB and SQL databases

- Prototype with NoSQL database [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

- Learn SQL with [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) or [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)

- Cache with NoSQL database [Redis](https://redis.io/)

## Land a job
If you've done all the recommendations above, go to my [Land a job](/5.-land-a-job) page
1. Create an Resume
2. Build a personal website to add to your resume (like this website)
3. Start applying to real jobs!

## Extras
> nice to have, but not necessary (get a job first!)
- Helps if you have a degree in data science, computer science, or any of the STEM degrees

- Or at least a bootcamp to show you put in the effort to learn the basics to code

- If you are really dedicated and refuse to get a degree or go to a bootcamp, then you better have Github repos that show practical applications

- You could just land a corporate job if you are really good with the Leetcode interview problems I provided at the beginning, skip all the extra effort (but if you hate toy problems, then you usually find yourself in small to mid-sized companies)

- Big O notation and other stuff you can google as you learn from your interview mistakes

[Go language](https://go.dev/) is a great infrastructure language to build in, but like I noted before get a real job with Python and JavaScript first

[Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a great systems language to build more resilient systems, but once again like I noted before get a real job with Python and JavaScript first

Machine learning:
- Machine learning is basically:
  - Choose a model
  - Train on sample data
    - if successful move to next step
    - otherwise, choose a better model
  - Execute on real data
  - The process is continuous, so expect to iterate on new training data every day / month / year to improve your model to incorporate other features that become prevalent
- Start with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- Test out [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- Test out [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) with [Keras](https://keras.io/)
